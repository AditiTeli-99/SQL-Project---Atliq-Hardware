The project in your PDF is an SQL analysis of Atliq Hardware’s global sales data, focusing on providing actionable insights to enhance business strategies. Here's a summary for your resume:

Developed SQL queries and functions to generate fiscal year-based sales reports, specifically tailored for customers like Croma India. This involved converting calendar dates to fiscal periods aligned with Atliq’s September-August fiscal year.

Created a stored procedure to classify market badges (Gold or Silver) based on total sales volume, helping to segment markets effectively.

Built views to calculate net sales by aggregating pre- and post-invoice discounts, improving query efficiency and readability. These views supported additional insights on top-performing markets, customers, and products by net sales.

Generated reports on the top 5 markets, customers, and products by net sales for fiscal year 2021, along with a regional breakdown of the highest-grossing markets, facilitating data-driven decision-making for targeted strategies.

This project demonstrates your ability to design and optimize complex SQL queries, perform data aggregations, and create reusable database objects like views and stored procedures for insightful business reporting.

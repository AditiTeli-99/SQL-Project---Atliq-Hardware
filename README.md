# SQL-Project---Atliq-Hardware


# Project 
Dataset Size: Approximately 1.5 million records.
Goal: To deliver actionable insights on gross and net sales, market segmentation, and top-performing customers, products, and regions.
Key Components
User-Defined Functions:

# Created functions to align dates with Atliqâ€™s fiscal year (September 1 to August 31), crucial for generating accurate year-over-year comparisons in sales reports.
Stored Procedures:

# Developed stored procedures to assign market badges based on sales volume:
Gold Badge: Markets with over 5 million units sold.
Silver Badge: Markets with fewer than 5 million units sold.
This classification helps Atliq assess market performance quickly and adjust strategies accordingly.
Views for Sales Calculations:

Designed views to handle complex calculations of net sales by integrating pre- and post-invoice discounts.
# Views created:
